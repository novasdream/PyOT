Before we go beta1 (or rather, before we go alpha2). Fix these things:
- [PROTOCOLS] Max items per client per client version (and send a replacement item, like ground if it's a ground item, sword if it's a sword...).
- [PROTOCOLS] Max effect id per client version (just send poff or something if it's above).
- [PROTOCOLS] Max animation id (just send a common shoot effect if it's above)

- [CORE] Proper assist and multiple-player-kills tracking.

- [SCRIPT] beds (needs offline training, hp/mana/soul regen)
